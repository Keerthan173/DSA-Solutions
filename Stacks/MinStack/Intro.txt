What is a Min Stack?
A Min Stack is a special kind of stack that supports all regular stack operations like:
    push(x)
    pop()
    top() or peek()
    plus one extra operation:
        getMin() → returns the minimum element in the stack in constant time O(1).



❓ Why Do We Need a Min Stack?
In a normal stack, if you want to find the minimum element:
You would have to traverse the entire stack → takes O(n) time.

A Min Stack allows:
Getting the minimum element in O(1) time.

This is useful when you need to track minimums efficiently, especially in problems involving:
    Dynamic minimums
    Sliding window minimums
    Real-time stock prices, etc.
